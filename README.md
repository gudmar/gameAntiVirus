# gameAntiVirus
##Description
This is a game written already a while ago. Your computer was infected by viruses causing popups to appear. Your task is to close all popup windows and launch anti virus program (situated in menu start). Beware! At the time of launching antivirus all popup windows have to be closed, or you will not succeed. This makes this game quite difficult. Only time good for winning is taking advantege of the fact, that first popup will appear no sooner than about 10s after hardnes level is chosen.
Personaly I passed this game on easy level. I believe, that if someone tires really hard it is possible to make it on medium level. Hard is impossible to winn. It is probebly good for measuring computer performance, because of great number of popups appearting. Each popup changes its position in time, so many timers are started at the same time.
##Scere
It is easiest to finish game before first popup appears, however this gives no points. For best score game should be won just before time ends.
##Timer
There is a timer in upper right corner counting time left to game lost.
##Images
SVG images used in game are not my. They were borrowed, and links to sources are available after clicking a question mark in start menu
##WindowsXP
Game background makes impression of WindowsXP. This similarity is used only, because I wanted to make it look recignizable.
##Gulpfile
There is a gulpfile and package.jsons needed to recreate enviorement. Its task is to make a single file, to make game more mobile.
